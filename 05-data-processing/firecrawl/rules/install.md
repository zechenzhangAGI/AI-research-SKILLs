  Install the Firecrawl CLI and handle authentication errors.

# Firecrawl CLI Installation

## Quick Install

```bash
npm install -g firecrawl-cli
```

## Verify Installation

Check if installed and authenticated in one command:

```bash
firecrawl --version --auth-status
```

Output will show:

- Version number
- `authenticated: true` or `authenticated: false`

## Authentication

If not authenticated, run:

```bash
firecrawl login --browser
```

The `--browser` flag automatically opens the browser for authentication without prompting. This is the recommended method for agents. Don't tell users to run the commands themselves - just execute the command and have it prompt them to authenticate in their browser.

## If you fail to authenticate, use the following error handling instructions:

If ANY command returns an authentication error after you ran `firecrawl login --browser` (e.g., "not authenticated", "unauthorized", "API key"), use an ask user question tool if available (such as the AskUserQuestion tool in Claude Code):

**Question:** "How would you like to authenticate with Firecrawl?"

**Options:**

1. **Login with browser (Recommended)** - Opens your browser to authenticate with Firecrawl
2. **Enter API key manually** - Paste an existing API key from firecrawl.dev

### If user selects browser login:

Run `firecrawl login --browser` to automatically open the browser. Wait for them to confirm authentication, then retry the original command.

### If user selects manual API key:

Ask for their API key, then run:

```bash
firecrawl login --api-key "<their-key>"
```

Or set the environment variable:

```bash
export FIRECRAWL_API_KEY="<their-key>"
```

Tell them to add this export to `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc` for persistence, then retry the original command.

## Troubleshooting

### Command not found

If `firecrawl` command is not found after installation:

1. Make sure npm global bin is in PATH
2. Try: `npx firecrawl-cli --version`
3. Or reinstall: `npm install -g firecrawl-cli`

### Permission errors

If you get permission errors during installation:

```bash
# Option 1: Use sudo (not recommended)
sudo npm install -g firecrawl-cli

# Option 2: Fix npm permissions (recommended)
mkdir ~/.npm-global
npm config set prefix '~/.npm-global'
export PATH=~/.npm-global/bin:$PATH
# Add the export to your shell profile
```

### Specific Instructions for Codex

When a user selects to authenticate with a browser, run `firecrawl config --browser` to automatically open the browser for authentication without requiring interactive input.
